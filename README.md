hello-world
===========

# Intro
This is how the event was. First, we met people and ate pizza.
# The talk
Then, Mike gave a talk. He told us about:
1. the fire alarm
2. how to control the temperature in the room by opening and closing the windows.
3. How he loves computers and GitHub.
4. 
# Hello World
Then we made
* a repository
* a branch
* a pull request
as part of a Hello World tutorial. 

## Here is some code Mike told us about earlier:
```
10 write 'poo'
20 goto 10
```
# The end
That's all there is to say about Mike's amazing GitHub patchwork event in Edinburgh. Woohoo! As Mike always says, 
> Make a pull request
# After the end
 We forked repositories and made pull requests and then it maybe was the end from @annaqui
